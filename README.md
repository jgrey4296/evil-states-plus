Where I shove little [evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) -states i write.

## Paren State

A simple state to move by [smartparens](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens) sexp movements.

It's really simple, but sometimes you just want to move around by expressions in lisp,
instead of lines and words.

By default, binds "H", "h", "l" "L" "k" "K" "j" "p" "u" "o" "i" for movements
and "q" to quit back to normal-state.

## Insert-Plus State.

For when you don't want spaces, you want something_else_when_you_press_space.
